# ISO-27001

# How I would explain a 5 year old kid about ISO 27001

Imagine you have a treasure chest full of toys, some more special than others. ISO 27001 is like a special set of rules to keep your treasure chest safe.

Keeping things secret: Some toys are super secret, like your favorite stuffed animal. The rules help hide those toys from anyone who shouldn't see them.
Keeping things safe: Maybe you have a toy car that breaks easily. The rules can help you build a fort around it to keep it from getting hurt.
Making sure nothing goes missing: The rules remind you to close the lid on your chest tight so no toys go missing by accident.
Knowing where everything is: The rules can help you keep track of all your toys, so you can always find them when you want to play.
By following these rules, you can be sure that your precious toys are safe and sound, just like ISO 27001 helps companies protect their important information!
